This program is written is RISC-V Assembly. It is a very simple program that takes input in radian and output its sin(input).
Assembly doesn't have a inbuilt sin function so this was manually created. Program is accurate upto 15 decimal places.

sin.s is the main program. You can manually enter an input by directly compiling this. 

common.s runs sin.s through various inputs for testing/presentation. 

You can use RARs to run the program.
